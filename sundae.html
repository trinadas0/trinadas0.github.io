        <h1>Sundae:</h1>
        <h2>a task management app</h2>
    </section>

    <section class="content" id="content">
        <h1>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h1>
        <p>Sundae was conceived as a self-guided student project, inspired by the challenges faced by a friend with ADHD who struggled with conventional task management apps. The dual purpose was to address the functional shortcomings of existing apps and align with a broader strategy of creating a visually appealing and emotionally resonant solution.</P>
        <h1>THE LEADING QUESTION</h1>
        <h2>Who says productivity can't be cute?</h2>
        <h1>(VERY) EARLY IDEAS</h1>
        <div id = "sketch-container">
            <img src="imgs/sketch.png" alt="Early sketch" class="parallax-image">
        </div>
        <h1>THE TARGET AUDIENCE</h1>
        <p>The motivation for Sundae stemmed from a desire to provide a solution for individuals like my friend, and by extension, a broader audience seeking a more engaging task management experience. The project, being self-guided, enabled a personal connection to the users and their needs, shaping the design with empathy and understanding.</p>
        <h1>USER RESEARCH</h1>
        <p>To create a task management app that truly resonated with users, I conducted a series of user research activities to understand their pain points, preferences, and expectations.</p>
        <div id = "research-container">
            <div class = "line1">
                <div class = "container">
                    <h3>Techniques</h3>
                    <p>Conducted online surveys and in-depth interviews to understand user task management habits, challenges, and attitudes towards existing apps.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "container">
                    <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
                    <p>Discovered frustration with cold interfaces; users desired an engaging experience, leading to the decision to infuse Sundae with a playful aesthetic.</p>

                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    <p>Responded to user feedback about feeling overwhelmed by tasks; iterated on task organization by introducing customizable groups.</p>

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Faced limited responses from certain demographics; adapted the survey distribution strategy by reaching out to users from specific communities.</p>

        <h1>DESIGN SOLUTION</h1>
        <p>Guided by insights from user research, the design process aimed to create a solution that addressed functional challenges while providing a delightful and emotionally resonant experience. The goal was to make productivity both <span class="pink-text">effective and enjoyable</span>.
    
        Sundae's user interface was envisioned with <span class="pink-text">vibrant colors, friendly illustrations</span>, and a playful design language. The objective was to create a visual environment that felt inviting, reducing the perceived intimidation often associated with traditional task management apps. Users in this conceptual scenario reported a positive emotional response, enhancing their overall experience.
    
        Acknowledging the need for flexibility in task organization, Sundae introduced customizable groups in this conceptual phase. Users could hypothetically personalize their workspace, making it <span class="pink-text">uniquely tailored to their preferences and workflow</span>. This feature theoretically addressed the challenge of feeling overwhelmed, empowering users to take control of their task management experience.
    
        Micro-interactions were thoughtfully implemented to create a user-centric environment. From animated transitions to satisfying feedback sounds, every interaction aimed to make the user feel acknowledged and in control. These small details were envisioned to contribute to an overall positive and engaging user experience.</p>

        <h1>IMPACT</h1>
        <p>While Sundae is conceptual, let's explore the hypothetical impact it might have. In this scenario, Sundae's impact could be measured not just in terms of improved task management but also in a positive shift in users' attitudes towards productivity.
    
        Post-launch surveys might reveal a significant increase in user satisfaction and a higher likelihood of consistent app usage. The incorporation of gamification elements, such as achievement badges for completing tasks, could contribute to a sense of accomplishment and motivate users to stay organized.
    
        Sundae might have gained traction within specific communities, especially <span class="pink-text">those facing unique productivity challenges</span>. The app's user forums could become a space for sharing tips, personal success stories, and feature suggestions. This community-driven approach could hypothetically fuel the app's growth and continuous improvement.</p>

    <section class="future" id="future">
        <h1>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS</h1>
        <p>The success of the development stage of Sundae laid the foundation for future developments and improvements. In this conceptual phase, the team would be committed to an iterative design process, incorporating user feedback and staying ahead of emerging trends in both UX design and task management methodologies.
    
        Recognizing the importance of inclusivity, plans might be made to <span class="pink-text">enhance Sundae's accessibility features</span>. This could include optimizing the app for screen readers, improving color contrast, and providing alternative interaction methods to ensure a seamless experience for users with diverse needs.
    
        Considering the growing popularity of wearable technology, Sundae could explore integration possibilities with smartwatches and other wearables. This would <span class="pink-text">allow users to manage tasks conveniently on-the-go</span> and receive timely notifications for upcoming deadlines, even though this is a theoretical consideration for a student project concept.</p>
